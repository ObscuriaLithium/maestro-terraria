### Maestro: Terraria brings Terraria's reactive soundtrack into Minecraft – carefully adapted with smooth orchestration, layered transitions, and seamless integration into gameplay.

<br>

# Features

### Extensive Music Coverage
The pack features unique music across the Overworld, The Nether, and The End, with additional themes for biomes, villages, dungeons, boss fights, raids, weather events, and multiple world depth levels. Each situation transitions naturally into the next, ensuring consistent atmosphere without abrupt cuts or repetition.

### Advanced Usage Example
Maestro: Terraria can also serve as a reference implementation for developing your own music packs with Maestro. The project demonstrates advanced use of track priorities, layered orchestration and composite conditions working together in a real production setup.

# Good to Know
